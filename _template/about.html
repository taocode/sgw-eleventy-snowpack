  <p>This site is produced by <a href="https://horseandfoxjoints.com/">Horse &amp; Fox Joint Productions</a> - a couple of humans that are aiming to pass on something useful to our fellow humans. This information reflects our views and has been paid for by us. Our interest is in your health and well being; we hope you find it both useful and entertaining.</p>

<h2>OK, but why? <em>Really.</em></h2>
<p>Because we were bemused by the idea of what a Surgeon General's warning on Sugar would look like and based our statements off the Surgeon General's Warning printed on cigarrette packages added in the 80s. This site and the resulting <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_nvhsjC0VOP5Ab8ABCuGeTbRDGwUzfFR/view?usp=sharing">warning label sheet</a> were then produced. Please feel free to print out your own warning labels and stick them to packages of high sugar foods in your pantry or in your favorite store.</p>
<p>The language is likely firmer than what someone official might tell you but we stand by the dangers and complications of excess sugar consumption on your health.</p>
